# Good-Match
The scenario
A local tennis club has decided to organise a tournament open to the general public as a way to
promote tennis and the club itself.
They have advertised widely and received many responses from people that are interested. As
with any major tennis tournament there will be a mixed doubles event. Partners will be allocated
according to an algorithm they have devised and you have been approached to write the program.

## Steps to run the program
* run: npm install
* run: node app.js [option1] [option2]
